### ME 🫡

🐍 At the moment I'm learning ***Python*** and have working myself through CS50P from harvard and EdX. 
👷‍♂️ Work-related has mostly been ***VBA*** and ***SQL***

Made an deck-building game as a learning project, and working on a internal work-tool fetching data from various sources --> ETL --> vizualise

Python libraries I have dabbled in so far:
  - Tkinter (Customtkinter)
  - Flask
  - Streamlit
  - SQLalchemy
  - Pandas
